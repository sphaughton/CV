Sean Haughton
======
Born in London, I am a full-stack web developer and April 2015 graduate of Makers Academy (a 12-week immersive web development course). I am passionate about behaviour-driven development, graphic design, and the idea that these means of communication should be accessible to everyone. As an internet-obsessed 15 year old I discovered the ability to alter existing Blogspot and Myspace themes using HMTL and CSS and at 18 found myself agreeing to make HTML-based mail-outs for Banquet Records (a store and label with 10,000+ person-strong mailing lists). After leaving that position, I discovered as time passed that the urge to explore how I could take that further never really left me.

Informed by a lifetime obsession with DIY punk counterculture, I have a restless need to pick up new skills outside of my comfort zone that can be used for positive change. I am also a practitioner of multiple disciplines of visual and performing art (primarily drawing, photography and music). I am currently seeking a Junior web developer position at a forward-thinking company in London, New York or Philadelphia that will allow me to grow and learn.

Skills
------
#### Excellent Communicator (Verbal/Written)
* I have worked on numerous projects as a freelance graphic designer, creating work designed based on the wishes of international clients.
* Undertook a year-long apprenticeship in Barbican Centre’s theatre department, responding to the majority of the department’s customer feedback and complaints, liaising with our Marketing department to proofread and suggest changes to promotional material and regularly greeting visitors arriving to meet with the Head of Theatre.
* Other duties at Banquet Records involved collecting tickets and helping stage-manage the various local club nights and instore performances, handling individual Facebook event queries and writing many of the product descriptions for the website. Much of the store’s brand relies on local community and knowing the staff by name.

#### Strong Teamwork
* As a Care Support Worker for St Martin of Tours, constant communication and handover meetings were essential. Staff had to be on the same page about outstanding tasks to be completed, potential dangers and problems, medication orders, safety and the needs of clients at all times.
* Helped direct 30+ children ranging from 1 to 3 years old as a Nursery Assistant at Clive Hall Day Nursery, which had to be a team of at least 2 people at all times.

#### Proactive
* On the course at Makers Academy, I was required to understand technologies at a quick pace and use them. I also learnt how to implement several technologies not on the course such as Image Magick and Pusher. 
* Self-taught in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Indesign CS3 - CS6.
* Former member of an active touring band for 4 years, which required me to take the lead on several projects and constantly stay level-headed while multi-tasking. During my time as a part of this, I worked to schedule releases, design and print art, made wholesale shirt orders, organised van hire and ran several consistent social media platforms. I also booked flights and a full UK tour for an Italian band and facilitated UK performances for a group from Japan that spoke little-to-no English.
